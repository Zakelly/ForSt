# Contributing to ForSt

## Code of Conduct
The code of conduct is described in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Basic Development Workflow
As most open-source projects in github, ForSt contributors work on their forks, and send pull requests to ForStâ€™s repo. After a reviewer approves the pull request and all the CI check are passed, a ForSt team member will merge it.

## Code style
ForSt follows the RocksDB's code format.
RocksDB follows Google C++ Style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
Note: a common pattern in existing RocksDB code is using non-nullable Type* for output parameters, in the old Google C++ Style, but this guideline has changed. The new guideline prefers (non-const) references for output parameters.
For formatting, we limit each line to 80 characters. Most formatting can be done automatically by running
```
build_tools/format-diff.sh
```
or simply ```make format``` if you use GNU make. If you lack of dependencies to run it, the script will print out instructions for you to install them.


## License Claim
ForSt is licensed under Apache 2.0 License. But since the RocksDB has its own license, we keep the license claim on top of each existing files, and use/add Apache 2.0 License on top of each new created files.

## Submit patches
Before you submit a patch, we strongly recommend that you share your ideas with others
in the community via [Issues](https://github.com/ververica/ForSt/issues) or 
[Discussions](https://github.com/ververica/ForSt/discussions). Of course, you do not
need to do this if you are submitting a patch that can already be associated with an 
issue, or a minor patch like a typo fix. You can then submit your patch via 
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/ververica/ForSt/pulls), which requires a GitHub account.
