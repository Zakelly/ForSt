## ForSt: A Persistent Key-Value Store designed for Streaming processing

ForSt is developed and maintained by Flink community and hosted by ververica.
It is built on top of [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) by facebook.

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

See the [github wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki) for more explanation.

The public interface is in `include/`.  Callers should not include or
rely on the details of any other header files in this package.  Those
internal APIs may be changed without warning.
